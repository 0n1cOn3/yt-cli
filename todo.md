-Examine if "Go back to videos list" is working properly
-Add an option for searching for videos, for now there is an issue with that because the link for searching is broken or soup doesnt recognise it idk why
-Every video is getting opened in mpv 2 times instead of 1 for some reason
-Add an option for adding and removing channels from channels.go inside of the program, I can propably achieve that using some file writing method
-Fix the playlist links showing up in the videos list when using search
